## Spike-Sorting: EEG Dataset
## Data Processing
The provided “training” data is shown in Figure 1. The file contains 1 440 000 recordings collected over  57.6 seconds. Recordings involve spikes of 5 different classes and a large amount of background noise (Figure 2). To continue working with this data and to reduce any errors caused by noise, filtering is applied.
